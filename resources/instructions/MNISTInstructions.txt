Classify handwritten digits!

We are using the same data set as last time, but this time, you get to use a library.

Apply all the optimizations you can (dropout, different optimizers, variable learning rates).
Your accuracy should be significantly higher this time, and your network should train faster.

Rules:
- All programs must be python3
- Use keras or tensorflow
- Submit your code by the end of the week
