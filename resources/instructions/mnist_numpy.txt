Classifying Handwriting Digits
__________________________________________
You will be classifying the famous MNIST dataset.
The raining data is available in csv form at the link.
While most libraries have a built-in function to access the MNIST data, you will not.

This is because your task is to:

1. Write a neural network in Python.
2. You are only allowed to use the Numpy Library.
No scikit-learn, Tensorflow, or Keras.

As usual, we will re-train your network on the training set, and test on the testing set.
