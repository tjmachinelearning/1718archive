In this challenge, you must identify which images contain a specific invasive plant from Asia in the Brazilian forest. 

Transfer learning is highly recommended for a problem this complex. 

For those that are feeling truly daring, image segmentation can even be tried for potentially better results.

Rules:
- All programs must be python3
- Use keras or tensorflow
- Submit your code by the end of the week
