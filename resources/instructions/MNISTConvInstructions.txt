Classify handwritten digits!

Each input is an image that is 28x28. This is similar to the previous challenge except we will work on the images to see how CNNs perform better.

Train on the given data and make sure it works. We will retrain your model and test it.

The data file describes how you can import the dataset using keras.

Rules:
- All programs must be python3
- Use keras or tensorflow
- Submit your code by the end of the week
