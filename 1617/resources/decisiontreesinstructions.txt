The data (bupadata.txt) is actual data of patients with liver disorders. There are two categories of patients.
These categories are represented in the 7th parameter of each line.

Each line of data contains:
1. mcv mean corpuscular volume
2. alkphos alkaline phosphotase
3. sgpt alamine aminotransferase
4. sgot aspartate aminotransferase
5. gammagt gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
6. drinks number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day
7. category

Your goal is to create a decision tree that best sorts the data into the categories indicated by the 7th parameter.

We will be retraining your algorithm on the data before testing accuracy.
