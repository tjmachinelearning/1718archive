----------- Your Task ---------------------------------

Modify the shell to take in the mushroom data.
(The mushroom data basically has a "p" for poisonous or an "e" for edible in the first column, 
and bunch of other letters for different attributes in the other columns. You want to classify
the mushrooms based on whether they are edible or poisonous.)

You may want to refer to the SVM shell for data input.

Use 25% of the data for testing.
Tune the hyperparameters to increase your accuracy.

Turn in your code by Monday night (2/20) to tjmachinelearning.com/submit.
Submissions will be ranked by testing accuracy.
